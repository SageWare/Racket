# Racket

### Thanks_For_Looking
* A simple racket art project for UBC's "How to Code: Simple Data" course. Uses BSL syntax & the image teachpack. We were required to generate various shapes, use layers, give it a Title, and provide our name. Used as an introduction to a number of basic image construction functions and was the first program I ever wrote to generate graphics.
